Extract data from vbox unit for analysis

files are stored as text in a .vbo file

There are two files that extarct data, 
get_data.py which works fine in a basic script
readvbox.py is an OOP script which is now also working

Next steps are to smooth velocity data, 
create a Stroke rate variable from the velocity data 
and add a distance column for analysis.

vbox.py is a file from github user Quentinlets which does similar work and is the basis of this code.
